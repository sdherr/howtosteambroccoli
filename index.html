We've been building up to this day for a long time now, and we are happy to share that the Kickstarter campaign for Tether is happening right now.
                                </p>
                                <p>
Without your support, we will not be able to print our games to share with the world.

A couple of us were on a recent episode of The Game Designers of North Carolina Podcast to talk about How To Steam Broccoli.
We talked about why we started the company and the thinking behind the How To Steam Broccoli philosophy.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                <p>
We are a North Carolina based company and TantrumCon is a North Carolina based convention, so it only makes sense that we will be there this coming weekend to enjoy the show and demo Tether.
If you're attending, swing by our demo table to say hello and play Tether with us.
                                </p>
