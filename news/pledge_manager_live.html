We signed a contract with Panda Game Manufacturing to print Tether.

They have a long track record of producing some of the most beautiful and high quality games in the industry, which is a huge part of the reason we are excited to work with them.

                                <p>
Our current work consists mainly of file preparation for the printer and making sure all our plans are in place for when it’s time to ship the games in a few months.
It’s exciting to see the pieces coming together.
Thanks for being a part of this journey with us.
